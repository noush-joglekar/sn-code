# Single-nuclei Isoform RNA sequencing (snisor-seq)

This is all original code generated for processing of data described
in our [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.29.474385v1). Scripts for generation of figure panels will
be compiled and added at a later date.

For now, adding scripts for:

- Extending barcode detection to allow mismatches
- Error correction to prevent 'molecule inflation' in UMI mismatches
- Coordination analysis for exon pairs
- Coordination analysis for exon-endsites

Feel free to [email](mailto:anj2026@med.cornell.edu) with questions
about the data or approach
